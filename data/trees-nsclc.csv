However, closer inspection of clusters 5 and 6 specifically in region 3 (where the conflict occurs) reveals that erroneous copy number correction may have resulted in high cellular prevalence values of clusters 5 and 6 in region 3. Taken this into account it is possible to construct a simple phylogenetic tree for CRUK0004. In brief, cluster 2 is present at high cellular prevalence values within each tumor region, suggesting this is the founder clone. Clusters 5, 3 and 1 must represent separate branches of the tree as these are present at high cellular prevalence values in distinct regions.
